    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
      <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
      <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.</p>
    <p>It is Photo Amaze's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect on the website.</p>
    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>Like most website operators, Photo Amaze collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Photo Amaze's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Photo Amaze's visitors use its website. From time to time, Photo Amaze may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
    <p>Photo Amaze also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Photo Amaze only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>Certain visitors to the Photo Amaze website choose to interact with Photo Amaze in ways that require Photo Amaze to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Photo Amaze gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a private maze to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Photo Amaze are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those transactions. In each case, Photo Amaze collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Photo Amaze. Photo Amaze does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
    <p>Photo Amaze may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Photo Amaze may monitor the most popular public searches. Photo Amaze may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Photo Amaze does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>Photo Amaze discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Photo Amaze's behalf or to provide services available at the Photo Amaze website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Photo Amaze website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Photo Amaze will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Photo Amaze discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Photo Amaze believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Photo Amaze, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Photo Amaze website and have supplied your email address, Photo Amaze may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Photo Amaze. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Photo Amaze takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Photo Amaze uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of Photo Amaze website, and their website access preferences. Photo Amaze visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Photo Amaze website, with the drawback that certain features of the Photo Amaze website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If Photo Amaze, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that Photo Amaze can no longer support itself or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Photo Amaze may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and in at our sole discretion. We encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
